# AIsearchAlgorithms
Implementation of AI graph search algorithms - BFS, DFS, UCS and A* search algorithms which worked well for graphs up to 30,000 nodes.

Input is given as a text file "input.txt"

input file format:

<searchAlgorithm> eg: bfs,dfs,ucs,a*
<number of nodes> an integer value representing the number of edges
<edges and their weights> eg: A B 4
.
.
.
<edges and their weights>
<number of hueristic lines>
<hueristic values> eg: A 10
.
.
.
.
<hueristic values>


output is generated as "output.txt" file. It contains the path traced by the algorithm.
